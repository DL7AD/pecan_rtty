Pecan RTTY
==========

This is the Arduino software for the old Pecan Femto 2 trackers. I want to point out
- Pecan Femto 1 has been build once and we never took the effort to bring it to work
- Pecan Femto 2 has been build once and this is the software for it.
- Pecan Femto 2.1 is a private Altium project. The software for the pecan Femto 2.1 is compactible to Pecan Pico 6 and can be found [here](https://www.github.com/DL7AD/pecan-lpc11xx).
